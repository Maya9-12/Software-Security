Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for their customers. They wanted to modernize their operations to better protect their client data and financial information by securing their public web application.
I was able to successfully identify vulnerabilites and develop an action plan to add extra layers of security.Coding securly ensures data is protected aganist threats which validates the company's reliability, an important characteristic customers look for when creating a financial plan.
The most challenging part of the assesment was creating a secure communication. Being as though I used a self signed certificate, I was unsure how to make the site secure without an SSL.
I increased layers of security by deploying the SHA-256 algorithm, the most approprate algorithm cipher given the security vulnerabilites.
Debugging and running the code often ensures that the application is finctional and running a second dependency check after refractoring the code ensured there were no new vulnerabilities.
Dependency checks were helpful with identifying vulnerabilities instead of manually checking each dependency.
I would like to point out my ability to refactor code that executes without error and performs its necessary functions.
